### Realised by me:
- Script "GameController"
   - Highlighting of an item which player looks at;
   - Opportunity to pick up an item which player looks at and which is highleted by button "E";
   - If player trys to pick up an item and they already have one in "holder", previous item will be dropped on the ground;
   - Opportunity to throw an item which player holds in "holder" forward by left mouse button;
   - Opportunity to open doors by button "E";

- Script "RayFromCamera"
    - A static class which contains a static method to helps to recognise an object which player looks at.
