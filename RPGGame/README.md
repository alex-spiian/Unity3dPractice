### Realised by me:
- Sctipt "GameController";
    - There are a bridge and a chest which contains a potion.
    - When the player come up to the chest the potion will be dropped from there;
    - If player doesnâ€™t pick up the potion they will not have the possibility to walk over the bridge.
    - if player picks up the potion they will be higlighted by outline and they can walk over the bridge and at the end of the bridge the fire will be lit
- Script "Potion";
    - Helps to find out was potion picked up by player using colider trigger.
- Script "MovementController"
    - Sets a direction where player should move by mouse position using Raycast;
